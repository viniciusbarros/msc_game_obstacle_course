I need create a new character for a game I am developing. I am a terrible drawer. I'll need to create a 2d model and later a 3d model of this character. 
This is  my moodboard. I want a funny pirate, which would have the body w/  traces similar to Rick, from ricky and morty, and visuals and happines similar to Killua (from HxH) and Zoro from One Piece. This is my mood board (see image).

Could you create a description that I could use to genreate 2d character that I could use as reference to draw my own character?

Here's a detailed character description you can use to generate a 2D reference for your pirate character:

Character Description: Funny Pirate
General Concept:
A quirky, fun-loving pirate with a mischievous yet endearing personality. He combines the exaggerated, lanky proportions and expressive face of Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, the carefree confidence and battle-ready stance of Zoro from One Piece, and the playful, childlike energy of Killua from Hunter x Hunter. His look is inspired by traditional pirates, but with a modern, comedic twist.

Physical Traits:
Body Type:

Lanky and slightly exaggerated, similar to Rick's body shape (long arms, slightly hunched posture).
Athletic, but not overly muscular—lean yet capable.
Stands with a casual slouch, but moves with sharp reflexes when needed.
Face & Hair:

Spiky, messy green-tinted hair (a nod to Zoro). Some strands stick out wildly, giving him a slightly unkempt but cool look.
Sharp, expressive eyes with a mix of mischief and determination. Eyebrows are thick and slightly angled.
A smirk or a wide, toothy grin is his default expression, but he can switch to an intense look in battle.
Light stubble or faint facial scars for a slightly rugged appeal.
Pierced ears with small pirate-style gold hoop earrings.
Outfit:

Pirate coat, but open and worn casually (like a rogue). The coat is dark with red or gold details.
A loose white shirt underneath, slightly torn from battles.
Baggy pants, tucked into cool pirate boots with straps.
A sash or belt with a dagger and small trinkets attached (could be magpie feathers or a small lucky charm).
Bandages wrapped around one arm or legs, giving him a battle-worn but cool look.
A pirate hat (optional) that he wears occasionally but usually just hangs on his belt or back.
Personality & Movement Style:
Funny & Laid-back, but with sudden bursts of energy and unpredictability (like Killua).
Loves challenges and danger, but never takes things too seriously—he jokes even in battle.
In combat, he’s flashy and creative, using unorthodox moves to trick enemies.
Swordsman style similar to Zoro but with unexpected tricks, such as throwing objects mid-fight.
Loyal to his crew, even if he pretends to be selfish at times.
Extra Details for Personality & Animation Ideas:
Laughter: A weird, exaggerated pirate laugh, maybe a mix between Zoro’s confidence and Rick’s dry sarcasm.
Idle Animations: He could occasionally flick a coin, juggle a dagger, or play with a magpie feather.
Jumping Mechanic: Instead of a normal jump, he could do exaggerated acrobatics, flipping playfully like Killua.
Expression Range: Super exaggerated—his face changes drastically depending on his emotions.
Key References from Moodboard:
Rick’s body shape & face exaggeration.
Zoro’s battle-ready presence & outfit influence.
Killua’s fun and mischievous energy.
Pirate aesthetics, with a mix of classic and rogue-like elements.
